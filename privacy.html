					<h1>Quoda Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p>
						Quoda is a software application developed for Android devices. Quoda was built by Henry Thompson, the
						"Developer". Quoda provides tools for users to edit text, and save them to both remote computers and
						third-party storage services. The "Service" refers collectively to any functionality
						provided by Quoda, as well as software maintenance and user support services from the Developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Quoda is a "Freemium" app. This means that the Service is provided by the Developer at no cost and is
						intended for use "as is", but some functionality may require a fee (the "Premium Upgrade") to use.
					</p>
					<p>
						This Privacy Policy sets out the policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
						Personal Information. Personal Information is any information which may be able to personally
						identify users of Quoda.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you choose to use the Service, then you agree to the collection and use of Personal Information in
						accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Personal Information that the Developer collects is used only
						for providing and improving the Service. The Developer will not use or share Personal Information with
						anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
					<p>
						While using the Service, the Developer may require you to provide Personal Information, including
						but not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Google Drive user details, and other Google accounts registered on the Android devices Quoda runs on;</li>
						<li>Dropbox user details; and</li>
						<li>Usernames, passwords and cryptographic keys for remote FTP servers.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Personal Information requested by Quoda is saved on the Android device that Quoda runs on. This
						Personal Information may be transmitted across the Internet only as is required to provide the Service:
						for example, an FTP username needs to be transmitted to the remote FTP server so that users of Quoda
						can log in to FTP servers. The Developer does not collect any Personal Information except as explained in
						this Privacy Policy. Quoda does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Links to privacy policy of third party service providers used by Quoda are below. This list may not be
						exhaustive.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Log Data</h2>
					<p>
						If you use the Service and it malfunctions such that Quoda crashes, the Developer may, via a third party service,
						collect information about the device that Quoda was running on at the time of the malfunction. This data is
						called Log Data. Log Data may include information such as the device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name,
						operating system version, the configuration of Quoda when utilizing the Service, the time and date of your use of
						the Service, and other information.
					</p>
					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>
						Cookies are files with small amounts of data, used commonly to anonymously identify a unique user. Cookies are sent to
						your browser from a website that you visit and are stored on your device.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Service does not use Cookies explicitly. However, Quoda may use third party code and libraries that
						use Cookies to collect information and to improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
						these Cookies, and should be informed when a Cookie is being used on your device. If you choose to refuse
						Cookies, you may not be able to use some of the Service.
					</p>
					<h2>Service Providers</h2>
					<p>
						The Developer employs third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To facilitate the Service;</li>
						<li>To provide the Service on the Developer's behalf;</li>
						<li>To perform Service-related services; and</li>
						<li>To assist the Developer in analyzing how the Service is used.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These third parties have access to Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them
						on the Developer's behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
					</p>
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>
						The Developer values your trust when providing Personal Information. We strive to adequately
						protect all Personal Information. Please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method
						of electronic storage is completely secure or reliable without fail. The Developer cannot guarantee,
						and therefore does not guarantee, the absolute security of your Personal Information, insofar as is permitted
						under applicable law.
					</p>
					<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
					<p>
						The Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that
						site. Note that these external sites are not operated by the Developer and do not fall under this Privacy Policy.
						Therefore, the Developer strongly advises you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. The Developer has no control over and
						assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
					</p>
					<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						The Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Developer does not knowingly collect Personal Information from
						children under 13. In the case that the Developer discovers that a child under 13 has provided the Developer with
						Personal Information, the Developer will immediately delete all copies of this Personal Information held by, and accessible to,
						the Developer. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided the Developer
						with Personal Information, please contact the Developer so that that the Developer may enforce this Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>
						The Developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically
						for any changes. The Developer will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes to the
						Privacy Policy are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
					</p>
					<h2>Contact the Developer</h2>
					<p>
						If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact the Developer by
						emailing hello@getquoda.com.
